## 📞 Questions or Modifications?

This campaign is comprehensive but flexible. If you need to:
- **Reduce budget**: Focus on Instagram + TikTok only, cut paid ads by 50%
- **Extend timeline**: Spread 12 weeks → 24 weeks (half the posting frequency)
- **Prioritize B2B**: Increase LinkedIn focus, add designer-specific campaigns
- **Go viral faster**: Jump straight to Phase 3 challenges (higher risk/reward)

All strategies can be adapted based on resources, timeline, and business priorities.
