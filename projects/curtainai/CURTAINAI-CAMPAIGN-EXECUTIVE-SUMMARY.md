## 💡 Top 10 Content Ideas to Start With

1. **Reel**: "The $5,000 Mistake I Almost Made" (mistake avoidance hook)
2. **TikTok**: "Stop Scrolling" hand-block hook with quick transformation
3. **Carousel**: "5 Signs You Need New Curtains" (educational + relatable)
4. **Pin Batch**: Modern living room curtains (20 variations)
5. **YouTube**: "Complete CurtainAI Tutorial for Beginners" (onboarding)
6. **Story Series**: Daily "Which style?" polls (engagement)

## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-branding**: Let the transformation speak, not the logo
2. **Ignoring UGC**: User content is more authentic and performs better
3. **Inconsistent posting**: Algorithm punishes gaps, rewards consistency
4. **No engagement**: Comment back within 1 hour for best reach
5. **Generic content**: Specificity wins (show actual rooms, not stock photos)
6. **Forgetting CTAs**: Every post needs a clear next action
7. **Not testing**: Try 3-5 hooks before committing to one format
8. **Neglecting Pinterest**: It's a slow burn but compounds over time
